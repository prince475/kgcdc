        description: `The "Complete without a Cut" initiative encompasses a multifaceted approach aimed at eradicating harmful practices such as female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and other forms of gender-based violence. One key aspect involves implementing Alternative Rite of Passage (ARP) ceremonies as a culturally sensitive alternative to traditional FGM/C rituals. These ceremonies celebrate the transition to adulthood without subjecting girls to the physical and psychological trauma of FGM/C.

        Additionally, the initiative focuses on strengthening protection structures and systems within communities to safeguard the rights and well-being of girls, boys, and women. This includes establishing support networks, advocacy campaigns, and legal frameworks to prevent and address instances of gender-based violence and harmful cultural practices.
        
        Community dialogues play a vital role in fostering mindset shifts and challenging social norms that perpetuate inequalities and harmful practices. Through open discussions and awareness-raising activities, the initiative aims to promote gender equality, empower individuals to make informed choices about their bodies and futures, and foster environments where girls and women are valued and protected.`
