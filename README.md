`Empowering Girls, Transforming Communities`

## Our Story

Kuria Girl Child Development Centre (KGCDC) stands as a beacon of hope and change, driven by the unwavering commitment of its founder, Robi Marwa, to dismantle harmful cultural practices and empower girls and women in her community.

Robi's journey began in 1974 when she defied tradition and refused to undergo female genital cutting, sparking a courageous path that inspired her siblings and earned her national recognition as a heroine and warrior.

Founded in 2012, KGCDC is dedicated to accelerating efforts to end Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), child marriages, teen pregnancies, and inequalities perpetuated by poverty, aligning with international commitments and legal provisions aimed at eradicating violence and discrimination.

Through advocacy, education, rescue efforts, and community sensitization, KGCDC strives to transform social norms and provide girls with opportunities for education and empowerment, confronting the entrenched practices that hinder their futures. In the face of staggering statistics and cultural barriers, KGCDC remains steadfast in its mission to protect the rights and dignity of girls and women, paving the way for a brighter and more equitable future for all.
